# Odin Recipes

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the basic HTML skills that I have developed.
This includes writing boilerplate HTML code, utilized various tags and elements, as well as combining it with my previous knowledge of using git with the terminal in order to commit, add, and push my local code to the connected GitHub repository.

This project is a website that contains three different favorite recipes of mine. The home page contains the links to the three recipes. Each individual recipe page will have the instructions for the recipe and an image of the finished dish.

Enjoy!
